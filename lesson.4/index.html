      <p>
        This assignment should be passed in via email as an attachment. Here is
        what I want you to do:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Save the web page as you are working on it with an .html or .htm
          extension.
        </li>
        <li>
          Just before you plan to send it to me, save it with a .txt extension.
        </li>
        <li>
          Send me the page with the .html or .htm extension and the page with
          the .txt extension as attachments to your email.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The reason for this is that depending on your email provider, sometimes
        the code gets changed in the .html or .htm version. Sending me the .txt
        version allows me to see the original code.
      </p>

      <h2>STEPS:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          To do your assignment, you should first open Notepad. Do a very simple
          web page using the very basic HTML code so you can test something
          simple.
        </li>
        <li>Save it with an .html or .htm extension.</li>
        <li>
          Go to Netscape Communicator and select FILE/OPEN PAGE or go to
          Explorer and select FILE/OPEN. Depending on the version you are using,
          you may see something else but try to find something that allows you
          to open a page. You then need to select the file. Note that in
          Explorer you BROWSE.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look at the results of your code. If it worked the way you want it to
          you are on your way. If not you need to return to the HTML in Notepad
          and make some changes, save the page with the changes and refresh in
          the browser to see the new version.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>To do this page effectively, I suggest that you look at my PowerPoint Presentations. Specifically look at the first two in the list <a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~spiros/teaching/SE101/slides/html.pdf">Presentations</a></p>

      <p>I also suggest that you look at my sample web pages unter HTML sample pages. Samples - look at the first 6 in the list</p>
      <p>When you look at web pages, you can see the HTML code by going to VIEW in your browser and looking for SOURCE or PAGE SOURCE or something similiar. The key word here is source.</p>

      <div class="table">
         <h2>The web page you pass into me should have the following elements:</h2>
         <table border 1px solid>
           <tbody>
             <tr>
               <td>H1 for a header</td>
               <td>Another header in range H2 through H6</td>
               <td>BR for break</td>
             </tr>
             <tr>
               <td>P for a paragraph</td>
